# Singleton Pattern

### Means that a class has only one instance, and this instance is publicly available during the whole runtime.
### It's useful for scenarios such as configuration, logging, and database connections.

### There are the following types of Singleton patterns:
- **Lazy Initialization Singleton**
- **Thread-Safe Singleton**
- **Double-Checked Locking Singleton**
- **Bill Pugh Singleton (Static Inner Helper Class Singleton)**
- **Enum Singleton**

# Mediator Pattern

The **Mediator** pattern is a behavioral design pattern that reduces coupling between components by having them communicate through a centralized object called the **Mediator**.  
Instead of interacting directly with each other, objects send messages to the Mediator, which handles the communication logic.

## Why Use It

- To reduce tight coupling between objects
- To simplify code maintenance and future modifications
- To centralize and manage complex interaction logic in one place

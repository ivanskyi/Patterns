# Facade Pattern

The goal of this pattern is to provide an easy-to-use interface for interacting with a complex system.  
In simple terms, the facade pattern is used to hide complicated logic behind a single simplified interface.

# When to use it:
- To simplify interaction with a complex system
- To hide implementation details from the client
- To reduce coupling between components

# Pattern elements:
- **Facade**: provides a simplified interface for the client
- **Subsystem**: performs the actual complex operations
- **Client**: uses the Facade instead of directly interacting with the complex subsystems
